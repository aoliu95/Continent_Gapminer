# A Bokeh Dashabord on Continential Development Gap
I used Bokeh and this [Dataset](https://github.com/aoliu95/Continent_Gapminer/blob/master/gapminder_tidy.csv) for building a dashboard on the time trend for Continential Development Gap, including varaibles like **fertility**, **life**, **child_mortaility** and **gdp**. 

Because Bokeh does not offer free platforms like [RShiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/), we need another web application deployment channel to host it. For me I used [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/). Here is the [live demo](https://bokeh-gap.herokuapp.com/bokehgap) on Heroku.
